# Logistic-Regression
This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression, a widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for classification problems. The main goal is to predict binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1) based on input features.

Key highlights of this project:

Data preprocessing and cleaning for better model performance

Training and testing a Logistic Regression model

Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, f1-score, precision, and recallt

Easy-to-use code for applying Logistic Regression to other datasets

The project is suitable for beginners learning machine learning concepts as well as practitioners looking for a template to apply Logistic Regression to real-world problems.
